# worktimer
 
 work days you have for the week.
And exit time when you did leave.

It has a live counter that shows you when you can leave from work.
It shows clock time when your day is done,
it shows you how long you were at work,
and it counts for whole week how many hours you need to do,
and shows how many hours you have left for the week.
